      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My son and I run a small business that designs and manufacturers custom phone 
        docking stations for niche markets. We grossed $14,000 in sales last year, and 
        anticipate a bigger year this year with an improved product and new customers 
        with new a new device launch. We use a SquareSite (https://duodocks.square.site/) 
        from Square to sell our product and handle all the payments, but would like to build 
        a website that showcases our product better: through pictures and video, with 
        customer testimonials, that can tell a better story for our products, as well 
        as share our company vision and contact information. We feel this will dramatically 
        improve perception and customer pull-through to the square site.</p>  

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this site is a niche market of cell phone users/owners; 
        those who have purchased, or are considering a purchase, of a Microsoft 
        Surface Duo or a Surface Duo 2. There is no comparable product on the market today, 
        and so we fulfill a specific need within this community. There are several facebook/reddit 
        community groups and youtube channels that are dedicated to this group that we target.</p>
