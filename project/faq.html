                <p>We ship everywhere in the world via Shippo. US shipping is a flat rate of US $5.00. International shipping is a flat rate of US $20.00.</p>
                <p>If you are a state of Washington resident, we charge sales tax. </p>
                <p>We don't charge the EU VAT, but you may be required to pay it when it arrives at your location, and it has been held at the local Post Office. 
                    We have had people not get notified that they have a package waiting at their Post Office. You should get tracking information from Shippo, 
                    and it would indicate that it is in this held state.</p>
