                <h2>About DuoDocks</h2>
                <p>In 2020 when I got my Duo, I asked Rylan to design me dock for it. Rylan's a wiz with 3d cad stuff. After showing it to people online, 
                    they amazingly asked if they could purchase one. I was surprised, and not sure I wanted to get into selling them.
                    But they helped us with feedback as we did multiple iterations on the design. Fast forward a few months, 
                    and we decided that we could learn a lot about how to run a business, and Rylan could use the money for college. 
                    So Jan 2021 DuoDocks was launched. In April, we started getting unsolicited publicity, 
                    and we had to purchase 2 more 3d printers to keep up with all the orders. </p>
                <p> We didn't stand still on the design, and improved the magnetic connector version during mid 2021, and we sourced additional 
                    magnetic connectors and cables to be able to supply to customers that would make their experience better. We learned that 
                    boxes protect our product way better than bubble mailers, and are worth the additional expense! </p>
                    <p>Above all, we learned that people are awesome, and that the Surface Duo has a loyal customer base! And we couldn't be 
                        prouder being part of this community.
                    </p>
                <h2>About Rylan</h2>
                <p>Rylan is currently enrolled at BYU-Idaho, studying Applied Technology. He does all the 3d cad, manufacturing, assembly and shipping. 
                    By purchasing a DuoDock, you are helping Rylan pay for college. Thanks!
                </p>
